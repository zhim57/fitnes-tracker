# Title : fitnes-tracker

## Description
Author: Jivko Atanassov

this app is an absolute nessessity in the present hidemand high speed way of life. Tracking of the exersises one does or does not each day is extremely vital to our well being . Only after several days of meticulous tracking I was able to deduct that I actually do not do any exercises at all. Was it not for the fitness tracker app, this would have been unnoticed by my otherwise very perceptive personality. So without further adou here is the "fitnes-tracker".
